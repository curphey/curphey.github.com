I live in Seattle with my wife and three kids (Jack, Hana and Gabe). I am British and grew up in England where I studied cryptography before working for a number of Investment Banks in London and moving to the States in 2000. I lived in Atlanta, San Francisco and Boston before settling in Seattle. In 2007 I took 2 years away from working and lived in a remote farmhouse in France. 

I have been involved in software security for the last 15 years and I have worked at a few startups (<a href="http://www.iss.net">Internet Security Systems</a> and <a href="http://www.foundstone.com">Foundstone</a>), a few bigger companies (<a href="http://www.schwab.com">Charles Schwab</a>, <a href="http://www.mcafee.com">McAfee</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>) and very recently started making plans to launch my own software security company in early 2013.

I am an enthusiastic distance runner, an atheist and a strong believer that healthy food is the key to good health (I am  currently trying a plant-powered vegan diet). I read a lot of books and love open source software. 

In the past I have done a lot of public speaking and contributed to several books on software security. I am currently writing a book called Practical Software Security that will be published by <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> in 2013. I founded a very popular online security community called <a href="http://www.owasp.org">OWASP</a> and am about to launch a new security community for software developers called <a href="http://www.seconauts.com">Seconauts</a>.
