In a video last week on the <a href="http://www.goodlifeproject.com/seth-godin/">Good Life Project</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com">Seth Godin</a> spoke about why he liked projects. Projects have definite lifetimes, you can jump in, experiment, learn and then right jump out again when it suits you. I also like projects for the same reasons as Seth but during the interview he said something else profoundly interesting that has had me gripped all weekend. When talking about technology disruption he said (and I paraphrase) '37 Signals can no longer be disruptive because they now have a large following and lots of customers. With that mass of followers and customers comes baggage.'

The mass has a gravitational force pulling everyone towards the mean viewpoint. The mass has a tendency to settle on an equilibrium that represents the majority. The mass is personally invested in things staying the same. The mass doesn't take risks. The mass works hard to maintain a status quo.

When you think something needs disrupting you have two paths you can follow. Try to convince the mass to change or do it anyway and hope they will come around to your vision when they see a different way. 

If you try to convince the mass you usually have resources at your disposal but have baggage. 

If you try to do it alone you usually have no resources at your disposal but have no baggage.

Technology disruptions like GitHub and Twitter and Ruby on Rails show time and time again that no resources and no baggage is usually a better option than resources that come with baggage.
