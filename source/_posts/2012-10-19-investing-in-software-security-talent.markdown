Every single person I speak to in the software security industry agrees on one thing. There is a talent war. Put another way the demand for good software security people far outstrips the supply,  or yet another way there aren't enough people to secure the software that needs to be secured for the digital economy to continue to growing at the current rate. I could go on but you get the point. To be clear this is not a security industry issue; it is a general software engineering issue but amplified in niche areas and the dial turned right up to eleven for 'red hot' niches. Most companies approach the issue by making their company a more attractive place to work. Bigger salaries, better perks and a better work environment. If you judged the state of the economy by the amount of recruiter calls you would think we are in boom times. A few days ago I watched the Presidential debate. 

Inspired by Barack Obamas speech about education and creating a workforce with the skills that are in demand, I started thinking about ways the security industry could invest in creating the talent that is in such high demand.
