<div class="entry-content"><p>I am embarrassed that I never got around to writing this post sooner. Over Christmas I took a whole week off from work and from being online. I needed it and enjoyed it immensely. I came to the conclusion that consulting full-time, writing a book, trying to start a community and launch a start-up all at the same time is not possible (for me at least) and somethings needed to give. I also realized that I needed to change some working habits so when I got back in the new year I made some decisions.</p>

<p>Seconauts is on hold for the foreseeable future. While I still believe there is room and need for a different type of software security community that appeals primarily to developers, I just don&#8217;t have the time to do it. I spent some personal money last year on a developer to work on the site and had a great group of folks lined up to help grow the community. We even had some impressive sponsor commitments but a community is more than a few people and more than money. That&#8217;s a marketing effort and there are enough of those out there. If it&#8217;s worth doing its worth doing right. It&#8217;s not dead but it it on ice. I will open source the code (Rails) if anyone wants to hack on it (we were close to doing that anyway). We needed a Wiki and a few other things added to make it a good base so there is  list to work down. If you are interested just let me know. On that note with the recent shift of Google+ to create community software I am now not convinced that building a community site as opposed to using a community site is a great investment although that is another topic. I always wanted us to eat our own dog food.</p>

<p>My priority for 2013 are very much focused on <a href="http://www.sourceclear.com">SourceClear</a>. We have the first few developers (my co-founders) ramping up, a wonderful academic data scientist / mathematician and a very strong advisory board who believe in what we are doing. We are building a product (nothing like it exists on the market today and we are solving a very compelling problem) but we will be leading with services and training (some of which we plan to sell through an indirect partner model). We will launch a public website sometime in the next month or so, probably after RSA) and have some neat free tools / code brewing! It&#8217;s time for some innovation in the software security space and we are going to bring it!</p>

<p>I am woefully behind on the Practical Software Security Book although making steady progress. I am going to stop predicting publication dates at this point as I can&#8217;t seem to finish the content that will allow my co-authors to start their work in earnest but it is coming along and will happen. What I have completed I am really happy with and have been using on some consulting projects working with developers with great success.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed my time away from Twitter and realized that while I value social media, I don&#8217;t have the mental capacity or fortitude anymore to filter the raw noise from the raw signal. Zite may not be perfect but it does a &#8216;good enough&#8217; job when fed my Twitter feed of only showing me stories that I seem to always find relevant.I have pruned my Twitter lists (culled them really) and am almost exclusively using Zite for news. Some may say &#8216;that just shows you don&#8217;t get Twitter&#8217; and they maybe right but it works for me. I have found over time that I like stories from established press sources and a few selected individuals although totally appreciate people who have found the exact opposite. I know there are lot of people with a lot of important and valuable things to say but there are only 24 hours in each day and I am not able to process it all.</p>

<p>On that note I have actually managed to find 26 hours for at least five days a week (working days) and its a neat personal hack that you might want to consider. In November I moved into a <a href="http://www.agnesunderground.com">new office </a> which was a perfect time to change my daily pattern. I read that many successful people are early risers and struggling to find time to get everything done I started getting into the office at 7am. I always try and leave by 7pm even if I often continue working at home. From 7am to 9am I try and write and while consulting work often gets in the way I have effectively created 10 hours a week of extra working time.</p>

<p>OK back to playing with SalesForce, cash-flow spreadsheets and stock plans!</p>
