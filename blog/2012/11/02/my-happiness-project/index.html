<div class="entry-content"><p>I have been an arm-chair phyciatrist for many years reading books like Blink, Drive, The Dip and notably The Art of Happiness (a book that had a profound impact on me). I just read How to Be Happy, Dammit: A Cynic’s Guide to Spiritual Happiness. I say read but it was more a case of flicking through the slides as the book is an ordered collection of small pieces of advice set against relevant images.</p>

<p>Those that know me well often call me a ‘miserable git’ and while I usually dismiss it as ‘hogwash’ it’s probably true. I think I have very high standards and ‘don’t suffer fools gladly’. I know I have a short fuse and an even shorter attention span. I thrive under pressure so like to surround myself with high pressure situations. When I believe in something or am interested enough in something I don’t let go or take no for an answer and have to know every detail and if I can’t make something happen one way I’ll just try another way until I do. When these things are combined it’s easy to see why people confuse what I think as just being ‘driven’ with being miserable. I am hopeully never rude but I rarely go out of my way to consciously be nice.</p>

<p>I have tried several projects in the past from running (which resulted in a life-long passion) to being a vegan (which resulted in me now living on a predominantly plant-based diet) and of course many things that didn’t work. I have decided I am going to try a new project: actively working to be happy. It’s not that I am un-happy. I have a great wife, great kids, I am financially well off, I live in a great place and have good friends. I am healthy and generally enjoy life. Sure there are ups and there are downs but in general life is good. What I don’t have is that outward happiness that some people possess that seems to also translate into a deeper inner happiness. I always tell the kids that “behavior breeds behavior” and have always thought that you are part of the environment you create yet at the same time I am a ‘glass half-empty person’ and admit I can be pretty darn negative at times. But no more, life is not about the bad things but about good things.</p>

<p>If anything Hurricane Sandy teaches you anything it’s that we all have a limited time on this planet and you never know what tomorrow may bring.The tragedy and devastation on the East Coast (and the seemingly constant news of human suffering around the world) made me reflect on what I should be truly grateful for and also on how my life could be even better; how I could be happier.</p>

<p>I have started a bunch of experiments, some small and subtle, some big and bold. I will make notes and post them here as appropriate in the coming weeks and months. I don’t plan to lose being ‘driven’ or walking away from tough situations or pushing on important things but I think you can be ‘driven’ and happy.</p>

<p>If you reap what you sow then I am off to sow some happy seeds!</p>
