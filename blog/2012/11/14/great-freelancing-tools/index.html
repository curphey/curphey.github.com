<div class="entry-content"><p>I think I have a pretty sweet setup that lets me spend the maximum amount of time working on projects and the minimal amount of time dealing with over-head. Time is limited so I like using it wisely. These are the business tools I am currently using.</p>

<p>QuickBooks Online - My wife is a small business book keeper so I had some inside knowledge. I had two fixed requirements, the first that my books were accessible from a browser and the second that payroll was done directly from the books. There are many options like Wave Accounting and FreshBooks, QuickBooks generally just works and payroll integration is easy. We use Compupay for payroll which is cheaper than QuickBooks. While I really like Harvest App and RoninApp (and particularly the iPhone and desktop time app for Harvest) QuickBooks has time tracking free if you take the $39.95 a month subscription. Once a week my wife can pull in hours I need to bill, sync the expenses (see below) and electronically invoice. Bam!
ShoeBoxed - Colleagues now how much I hate doing expenses. Almost everyone I know finds submitting expenses frustrating and time consuming. I used to spend two hours for every week I was on the road scanning receipts and filling out online forms. Meet ShoeBoxed. As I spend something I photograph the receipt from within the app. It get’s tagged and uploaded and is then available to be pulled onto QuickBooks. That’s it. Oh but wait it gets even better. The good folks at ShoeBox send you a blue envelope like the NetFlix DVD envelopes. If you don’t want to scan your receipts you just chuck them in the pre-paid envelope and mail it. Within a few days the scan them and add them to your account and return the paperwork for your records. I am yet to go through a complete cycle with this but so far it seems to work like a charm and save me 4 hours a month and a ton of frustration. It costs $49.95 a month but that is great value for my time. That’s 4 hours I get to spend with the family (or bill to clients).</p>

<p>TripIt - is a life-saver if you a travel a lot. You can give TripIt access to your gmail via OAuth to scan your mail and create trips based on travel confirmations. Being paranoid I just forward conformations to plans@tripit.com and it creates then for me. TripIt sends me alerts of gate changes usually before the screens in the airport get updated. When you land you get an alert that tells you where your connection is, how much time you have and even which baggage claim you need to go to if you checked in bags. I upgraded to the Pro version but frankly get nothing more than I used in the free version.</p>

<p>TomTom on iPhone - I used to carry a portable GPS but TomTom on the iPhone is always with me. When combined with a portable car windows mount and car charger it gets the navigation job done. I have struggled through with Google Maps and Hertz’s “Forever Lost” and while TomTom has its quirks, it just works 99% of the time.</p>

<p>SpiderOak - Fully encrypted backup where the provider never sees the data in the clear. You can sync across boxes.</p>

<p>Remember The Milk - I have used this app for years (web and iPhone client). It’s simple and effective. I have lists set up for Personal, Curphey LLC, Client-X, Seconauts, SourceClear, Book and Blog and just constantly re-prioritize. At the start of each day I look at what I didn’t get done yesterday and re-prioritize.</p>

<p>SalesForce - I have just set this up but people I trust swear by it. Don’t get fooled by monthly pricing, you have to pay for an annual license which is painful for a so-called “on demand cloud service” (over $700 for a Pro License) but for managing customer relationships and a sales pipeline it’s tough to beat. I will have the corporate web site post inquiries directly into SalesForce via the API and use it to drive mail marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>If you have great tools that save you time I would love to hear about them!</p>
